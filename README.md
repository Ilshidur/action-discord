## Usage

```yaml
- name: Discord notification
  env:
    DISCORD_WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK }}
  uses: Ilshidur/action-discord@master
  with:
    args: 'The project {{ EVENT_PAYLOAD.repository.full_name }} has been deployed.'
```

**NOTICE :** for stability purposes, it is recommended to use the action with an explicit commit SHA-1 :

`uses = "Ilshidur/actions/discord@4420243"` (=> link to the commits list : https://github.com/Ilshidur/action-discord/commits/master)

### Arguments

By default, the GitHub action will send a notificaction with the event informations. Providing the arguments will override the message.

**Environment variables** can be interpolated in the message using brackets (`{{` and `}}`) :

e.g.: `Action called : {{ GITHUB_ACTION }}`

**Event Payload** data can also be interpolated in the message using brackets (`{{` and `}}`) with the `EVENT_PAYLOAD` variable.

e.g.: `Action called: {{ GITHUB_ACTION }} as {{ EVENT_PAYLOAD.pull_request.id }}`

> See the [event types](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types) for valid payload informations.

#### Examples

* `args = "Hello, beautiful ! I ran a GitHub Actions for you <3"`
* `args = "I showed you my commit. Please respond."`

### Environment variables
